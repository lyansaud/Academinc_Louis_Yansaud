      <description>Executive Summary For several universities across the world, the implementation of a systematic approach to course scheduling remains a problem. Discrete optimization approaches have been used to solve the problem independently at such institutions, however owing to the complex nature of the problem compounded by the viewpoints of various stakeholders, a universal “cookie-cutter” solution does not exist.
