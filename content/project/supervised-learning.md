##### Description
This report provides a detailed analysis of the ‘applications’ dataset using supervised fraud algorithms and machine
learning statistical techniques.
The programming tools used for Data Cleaning, Modeling, and Evaluation were Microsoft Excel, Tableau, R, along with
mySQL through R. The original dataset contains unique records of more 90,000 product applications over the year 2016.
Necessary feature analysis include:
● Data Understanding and Data Cleaning (dealing with frivolous values)
● Feature Engineering (creating expert Variables, performing feature selection)
● Data Modeling (running fraud detection models)
● Data Evaluation (comparing model results)

##### Project Goal
Our objective for this project is to use a supervised fraud algorithm to build a fraud detection model that predicts product
application fraud with high predictive accuracy. More precisely, we aim to find the top performing machine learning
model that is able to predict the highest number of fraudulent cases with a low false positive rate.
The report will present several classification machine learning techniques for fraud detection and their performances on
our dataset, in complete detail such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient
Boosting Trees.

##### Key Findings
Here are the main key findings from building a Fraud Detection Model on the Applications dataset:
● The Gradient Boosting Trees method yielded the best Fraud Detection model at 10% penetration on the OOT (Out
of Time) dataset with a FDR (Fraud Detection Rate) of 13.02% including a FDR of 12.50% on the testing dataset
● The Support Vector Machine Method yielded the lowest Fraud Detection Rate (FDR) at 10% penetration on the
OOT (Out of Time) dataset with a FDR (Fraud Detection Rate) of 11.81% including a FDR of 11.01% on the testing
dataset
● Overall, Gradient Boosting Trees and Random Forest Models both demonstrated relatively high predictive
performance, with the highest predictive power in their respective segments
